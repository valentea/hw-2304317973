description: In this problem you will build a word search solver. Given a grid of characters and a target word, find all occurrences of a target word (of at least 2 characters) in the grid either vertically or horizontally (in either direction) by listing the row and column (using 0-based indexing) where the first character starts and in what direction the word extends.

Must pass all test ".in" files;
1object.in: A 1x1 grid, smallest possable valid grid (numbers): PASS
1row.in: A grid with multiple collums but one row (numbers): PASS
blankLine.in: A 3x3 grid with the middle row empty (numbers): FAIL
empty.in: A compleatly empty file: FAIL
givenGrid.in: Grid given in HOMEWORK RECORCES (letters): PASS
lastLineBlank.in: Normal grid with empty last line (numbers): PASS
uneven.in: Grid with uneven value of objects per row (numbers): FAIL
